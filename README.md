## Development
Make sure you have node and npm installed.
Then install pnpm via `npm i -g pnpm`. We use pnpm instead of npm.

Then, install all the packages. `pnpm i`
Then build with `pnpm build` and then run the server with `node .`

Rebuild and rerun server anytime you make changes to a ts file. Not needed when you make changes to the static files in `public/`
